## About the project
Creating an online presence can make or break a business, especially as a majority of business is being done online and retail commerce has taken a significant blow with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Horiseon is here to help blossoming businesses grow their online profile and be competitive in the online world.

The project so far is a landing page for the Horiseon company that is focused on providing online social solution services for their customers.  
The page is fairly simple but is setup so it can be grown if necessary. The top links currently link to sections below but can easily be linked to more pages when Horiseon sees fit.  
In an effort to reach the largest audience possible the page also includes alt text to aid those using screen readers or braille displays.

The project has been published at the following URL:
